# Multi-Player Game

In this I have created the multiplayer game using `python` and `pygame`.

## Usage

- clone the repo

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/karanBRAVO/Multiplayer_Game.git
  ```

- change the directory

  ```bash
  cd Multiplayer_Game
  ```

- start the server

  ```bash
  python server.py
  ```

- open up two new terminals then
- run the `mainGame` or `clientMessaging`
- `note:` run in seperate terminals

  ```bash
  python mainGame.py
  ```
